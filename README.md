## Project Overview
This project analyzes video game sales data to uncover trends and insights into game popularity across different regions, categories, and genres. The analysis provides a detailed understanding of video game performance over time, including the rise and fall of sales, as well as regional preferences. An interactive dashboard allows users to explore the data dynamically by selecting specific genres and titles.
